This volume contains presets for the rest of the non-beast races: a bosmer alchemist, dunmer necromage, imperial vigilant, orc berserker, and redguard hunter.

#### Liliana - Bosmer Athena
Poisons and potions, Liliana is a wise bosmer alchemist, creating some of the strongest toxins imaginable to coat her arrows and take out her foes, slowly, and carefully. <br> ![Liliana Action](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/liliana.png?raw=true) <br> ![Liliana Natural](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/liliana2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Liliana Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/liliana3.gif?raw=true)

#### Arla - Dunmer Athena
Death and taxes to the great houses, stuff Arla doesn't care about, having left Morrowind in search of greater necromancy. Studying dwemer ruins and falmer camps to see if any ancient magic hides beneath the ice of Skyrim. <br> ![Arla Look](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/arla.png?raw=true) <br> ![Arla Sit](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/arla2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Arla Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/arla3.gif?raw=true)

#### Julia - Imperial Matron
For this imperial, two things matter most: justice and coin. Julia is a Vigilant of Stendarr and pious worshipper of Zenithar, having been a bard in a previous life. <br> ![Julia Jewellery](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/julia2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Julia Service](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/julia.png?raw=true) <br> ![Julia Sitting](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/julia3.gif?raw=true)

#### Org'he - Orc Domina
Blood and brawn, Org'he learned the tough way of life living with the cursed tribe of orcs in Skyrim. As a berzerker, she charges into battle with or without armor, dual axes wielded, and charged by fury and whatever brew she drank the night before. <br> ![Org'he Laying](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/org%27he2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Org'he Spread](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/org%27he3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Org'he Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/org%27he.gif?raw=true)

#### Sherrin - Redguard Domina
From Hammerfel come the warriors with curved blades and exotic magic. Sherrin is a skilled hunter of man and beast, more recently of high elves too in her fight against the Dominion. Using alteration magic, her skin becomes as tough as ebony, and her weapons are infused with powerful arcane energy. <br> ![Sherrin Outreach](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/sherrin.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sherrin Sitting](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/sherrin2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sherrin Laying](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/sherrin3.gif?raw=true)

### VOLUME 1: SKYRIM'S HEROINES 
Download the first High Poly Character Compendium Exclusives pack from [here](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/STU-HPCC%20Exclusives%20Volume%201.7z)! This volume contains three archetypal characters: the brutal nord warrior, uptight altmer mage, and regal breton explorer. 

#### Helga - Nord Matron
Heavy weapons and a heavier **chest**plate, Helga is a powerful nord warrior, making use of the voice and two-handed weapons to cut waves into their foes, be they invading elves, imperials, or the native beasts and bandits of Skyrim. <br> ![Helga in Action](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/helga3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Helga Nope](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Helga.gif?raw=true) <br> ![Helga Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Helga2.gif?raw=true)

#### Sylandra - Altmer Athena
Attitude and amateurism run through this altmer mage, making her first **step**s into the college and already making more enemies than friends at a magical magnitude. <br> ![Sylandra Sit](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sylandra Step](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sylandra Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra.gif?raw=true)

#### Rosaria - Breton Domina
Solemn and stoic, this breton explorer has made her way from High Rock to Morrowind, then Cyrodiil and now the chilly province of Skyrim in search of akaviri and snow elf artefacts. She still takes her time to enjoy the small things in life; Good mead, good bards, and even better cheese! <br> ![Rosaria Views](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Rosaria Mead](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Rosaria Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria.gif?raw=true)
