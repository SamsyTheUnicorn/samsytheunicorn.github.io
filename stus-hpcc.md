Download the first High Poly Character Compendium Exclusives pack from [here](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/STU-HPCC%20Exclusives%20Volume%201.7z)! This volume contains three archetypal characters: the brutal nord warrior, uptight altmer mage, and regal breton explorer.

#### Helga - Nord Matron
Heavy weapons and a heavier **chest**plate, Helga is a powerful nord warrior, making use of the voice and two-handed weapons to cut waves into their foes, be they invading elves, imperials, or the native beasts and bandits of Skyrim. <br> ![Helga in Action](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/helga3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Helga Nope](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Helga.gif?raw=true) <br> ![Helga Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Helga2.gif?raw=true)

#### Sylandra - Altmer Athena
Attitude and amateurism run through this altmer mage, making her first **step**s into the college and already making more enemies than friends at a magical magnitude. <br> ![Sylandra Sit](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sylandra Step](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Sylandra Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/Sylandra.gif?raw=true)

#### Rosaria - Breton Domina
Solemn and stoic, this breton explorer has made her way from High Rock to Morrowind, then Cyrodiil and now the chilly province of Skyrim in search of akaviri and snow elf artefacts. She still takes her time to enjoy the small things in life; Good mead, good bards, and even better cheese! <br> ![Rosaria Views](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria2.png?raw=true) <br> ![Rosaria Mead](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria3.png?raw=true) <br> ![Rosaria Dance](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/rosaria.gif?raw=true)
