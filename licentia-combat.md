## COMBAT
My personal overhaul for combat in Licentia, featuring new combat animations and weapons in an attempt to souls-ify the combat system.

### A WARNING
This requires removing/disabling various mods and/or plugins, making large changes to the gameplay experience of Licentia. This list is made for third-person play, I do not play in first-person. You will also have to wait a few seconds after loading a save for the animations to load. Instructions are accurate to Licentia 10.50, some mod and plugin priorities may differ in updates.

1. In Mod Organizer, in the left-hand mod list, disable *Quiet Better Jumping for Combat Gameplay Overhaul (CGO)* (Priority 65) and *Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE* (Priority 789). <br> Find *Licentia Patches* (Priority 982) and double click, then go to the "Optional ESPs" tab and hide the following plugins: *CACO CR - LOTD vs CGO*, *CACO CR - VioLens vs CGO*, *CACO CR - ZIA vs CGO*, *CACO CR - BriDO vs CGO*, and *CACO CR - CGO vs Slide*. <br> Find *TUDM Patch Collection* (Priority 968) and follow the same process to hide *TUDM - Combat Gameplay Overhaul Patch*

2. Find the mod *Hand to Hand Rebalanced* in the left-hand mod list and right click, then reinstall mod. Make sure you select the "Vanilla Race Edits" option in the FOMOD window that appears. In the mod already installed window that appears, choose replace. <br> In the right-hand plugin list, move *Hand to Hand Rebalance - Race Attack Fix.esp* above *Vokriinator Black.esp* (Priority ~498). You should now no longer have any "Missing Master" errors

3. Now we can start getting SkySA2 set up! But first, the requirements; On Nexus, download the Special Edition version of [*Animation Motion Revolution*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50258), the main file from [*One Click Power Attack*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60878) and a DLL replacer for OCPA from [here](https://mega.nz/file/500kgB7T#vgj0I6B5rS2ViX-dkdK75_oM56NMqZVv_2f9LNQcRPw). <br> For OCPA, double click the mod in MO2 and under "INI Files" update the *OneClickPowerAttack.ini* to read as follows: <br> ![OCPA INI](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/combat-ocpa.png?raw=true) <br> By changing the highlighted line's value, you can change the hotkey used for power attacks, 22 is the "U" key by default, but you can find other key values [here](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script).

4. Download *SkySA 2.8* from the [Skyrim Guild mod page](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/skysa-2) and *Elder Souls Collection 0.9* from it's [mod page](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/elder-souls-v0-9). This is your framework and animations sorted, however, you may want to grab a couple extra individual combat animations based on your personal tastes, the only one I would strongly recommend is Orakin2020's [*Unarmed Normal and Power Combo for SkySA*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51193). <br> Hide the plugins for the Elder Souls Collection and move *SkySAv2.esp* below *Archery Tweaks.esp* and above *TrueDirectionalMovement.esp* (Priority ~461).

5. If you just wanted combat animations and no extra content, you can stop here and run Nemesis. However this step will cover the "Soulsification" of Licentia, just download and install the following: <br> - [Skyrim Platform](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54909) 2.6.0 for SSE <br> - [Disable Recoil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57428) v0.2a <br> - [Elder Souls - Sweep Attacks Standalone SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47395) Main File <br> - [Simple Offence Suppression](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41764) for SSE <br> - [Simple Offence Suppression MCM - Block Friendly Fire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41774) Main File <br> - [Simple Offence Suppression Block Friendly Fire - Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57700) Main File <br> - [Hellblade Timed Block](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/hellblade-timed-block) 1.2 from Skyrim Guild <br> - [Stagger On Hit SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52498) Main File <br> - [Stagger Direction Fix - SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43339) Main File <br> - [OnHit Animations Framework - SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42574) Main File <br> - [Flinching - Script Free Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42550) Main File with all Creature Options enabled in FOMOD <br> - [Killmove Paralysis Prevention](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65312) for SSE <br> - [Post-Hit Killmove and Execution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65117) for SSE <br> - [Projectiles](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/projectiles) from Skyrim Guild <br> - [Block Enchantments](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60833) Main File <br> - [Paulicus Poison Block (PPB) Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51046) Main File and Shields Only Edit <br> - [Thu'um - Fully Animated Shouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50559) Main File <br> - [Stop On Slash AE - Hitstop and Screenshake](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66155) for SSE <br> - [A Subtle Preset for Stop On Slash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61471) Main File <br> - [Jumping Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68043) Main File with Para Gliding Patch and SkySA 2.7 Patch <br> - [Vanguard](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/adris-projects/vanguard) 2.2 from Skyrim Guild <br> <br> After you enable all of the downloaded mods, you will have a list of new enabled plugins, move them below *SkySAv2.esp*, so your plugin order looks like this: <br> ![Combat Overhaul Plugins](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/combat-plugins.png?raw=true)

6. If you are interested in adding more weapons, and having those weapons be animated, you will need to get Animated Armory and add keywords to the weapons in your mod list, to do that, download and install the following: <br> - [Animated Armoury - DAR Version - New Weapons with Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) Main File, Heavy Armoury Patch and Immersive Weapons Patch. <br> - [Animated Armoury - Fixes and Enchantments](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47213) Choose only the Enchantments and Fixes Main Files <br> - [Fishing Rods are Rapiers - Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58924) Main File <br> - [LoTD - SUT - Animated Armoury Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42603) Choose only the LoTD Only Optional File <br> - [Animated Armoury Vigilant Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22964) Main File <br> - [Relics of Hyrule Community Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31935) Choose only the Relics Weapon Keywords - Animated Armory Patch 6.6.1.G - ESL Version-patchv3 Old File <br> - [Animated Armoury - CC Dead Man's Dread Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30502) Main File <br> - [Animated Armoury - Legacy of Dragonborn Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38813) Choose the DAR Main File and TCC Optional File <br> <br> After you enable all of the downloaded mods, you will have a list of new enabled plugins, move *NewArmoury.esp*, *Animated Armoury - Fixes.esp*, and *Animated Armoury - Enchantments.esp* below *AT - Immersive Weapon Patch.esp* (Priority ~244). Move *DBM_NewArmoury.esp* and *LOTD_TCC_NewArmoury.esp* below *CACO CR - USSEP vs CC.esp* (Priority ~926). The rest of the new plugins should be moved below *VIGILANT-Sewers.esp* (Priority ~1156). <br> Now we can patch the rest of the weaponry with a Synthesis patch, to do this, first disable *Synthesis0.esp*, *Synthesis1.esp*, *Undies2.esp*, and *SofiaNude.esp* temporarily and open Synthesis (Ensure you are running MO2 as an Admin and have an exception created in your Real-Time Protection for your modding folder). <br> In Synthesis, click on the GitHub Repo icon and search for SynWeaponKeywords and add this patcher, you will also need to search for, and add, speedandreachfixes. With only both of these enabled, run Synthesis. In your Overwrite in MO2, you should find a plugin, rename this however you like (I like *Weapons3.esp*), and add the plugin to a new mod or whatever mod you have your Synthesis plugins stored in. <br> Place the new plugin before your other Synthesis plugins, and open SSEEdit with only your new plugin enabled and change the file header to ESL.

7. Now you have everything installed, you just need to run the rest of your Synthesis patches, and run Nemesis. In Nemesis, make sure the following options in Nemesis are checked: *Archery Gameplay Overhaul SE*, *TUDM Attack Cancel*, *Dragon Priest Fix - Behaviour Overhaul*, *Flinching Animations*, *Hellblade - Timed Block*, *Animated Jump Attack*, *Maxsu Stagger Direction Fix*, *BashBehaviorsOverhaul*, *Skyrim's Paraglider*, *Retimed Hit Frame*, *SkySA*, *Crouch Sliding*, *True Directional Movement - 360 Horse Archery*, *True Directional Movement - Headtracking*, and *Ultimate Combat Creature Compatibility* then select the Update Engine button, then close and re-open Nemesis before selecting the Launch Nemesis Behaviour Engine button.

8. One of the patches for Licentia carries on changes to races made by CGO, you can directly download a version of this plugin, without the CGO race changes, directly from [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923586633238986874/971134861618315324/CACOS_RACE_CR.esp). Before adding this to your game, make sure to rename it as "CACO'S RACE CR.esp" so it overwrites the original plugin.

9. Now play the game! If you run into any issues like attacks not properly animating and just sending you zooming forward, try updating and running Nemesis again, this usually fixes missing animations. If you receive any errors when running Nemesis and T-Posing in-game, this is typically caused by trying to run Nemesis while Legendary Edition animations are present, make sure any animation mods you have, posers or combat, are up to date and made for Skyrim Special Edition only.
