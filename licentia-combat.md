> *My personal overhaul for combat in Licentia, featuring new combat animations and weapons in an attempt to souls-ify the combat system.*

## OUT WITH THE OLD

### Combat Gameplay Overhaul

Combat Gameplay Overhaul will conflict heavily with the mods that we are installing in this overhaul. So we will have to remove the mod and all of it's dependencies, replacing them where possible:

- <b>Combat Gameplay Overhaul</b>, found under the Melee separator, disable the full mod.
- <b>Quiet Better Jumping for Combat Gameplay Overhaul (CGO)</b>, found under the Essentials separator, disable the full mod.
- <b>Hand to Hand Rebalanced</b>, found under the Perks & Leveling separator, right-click and reinstall the mod, choose the following choices in the FOMOD: Vanilla Race Edits. When prompted, choose replace, then move <i>Hand to Hand Rebalance - Race Attack Fix.esp</i> directly above <i>Spellsiphon - Patch - Vokrii.esp</i>.
- <b>TUDM Patch Collection</b>, found under the Merges & Patches separator, double-click and move to the Optional ESPs tab. Select <i>TUDM - Combat Gameplay Overhaul Patch.esp</i> and hide it as an optional ESP.

### VioLens

VioLens may or may not conflict with the mods in this overhaul. I recommend removing it to avoid any issues with the killmove mods included, and so you can install [Poser Hotkeys](https://samsytheunicorn.github.io/licentia-poses.html) of course...

- <b>VioLens - A Killmove Mod</b>, found under the Melee separator, disable the full mod.
- <b>TUDM Patch Collection</b>, found under the Merges & Patches separator, double-click and move to the Optional ESPs tab. Select <i>TUDM - VioLens Patch.esp</i> and hide it as an optional ESP.
- <b>Licentia Patches</b>, found under the Merges & Patches separator, double-click and move to the Optional ESPs tab. Select <i>CACO CR - CGO vs Slide.esp</i>, <i>CACO CR - LOTD vs CGO.esp</i>, <i>CACO CR - VioLens vs CGO.esp</i>, <i>CACO CR - ZIA vs CGO.esp</i>, and <i>CACO CR - BriDO vs CGO</i> then hide then as an optional ESP.

### [CGO-Less Patches](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/CGO-Less%20Patches.7z)

Two of the major patches made by Caco carry on changes made to races by CGO. Download these replacement plugins created by Bingus that remove the changes to races and NPCs by CGO. Just enable and let overwrite existing plugins.

## IN WITH THE NEW
