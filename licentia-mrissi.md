## M'RISSI
A guide on how to add M'rissi with minimal issues to Licentia and integrate into Legacy of the Dragonborn alongside other companion mods.

### A FOREWORD
M'rissi's Tails of Troubles features some truly terrible dialogue options, and an alternative quest-line where you enslave Skyrim's catgirl, I am spoiling this here because you should not take this path, and this, paired with the childish attitude of M'rissi, is why the mod was removed from Licentia. These steps are for people who want to have the companion restored:
1. Download [*"M'rissi's Tails of Troubles SE 1.7"*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9666/),   a replacer of your choice (I use [Fluffy M'rissi Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53654)), and patches for [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59940) and [Magical College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1539). <br> You can install each of these normally, place the plugins below other Follower mods.

2. Legacy of the Dragonborn has a cool Safehouse, and thanks to mods, you can get rooms for all your favorite followers there, including M'rissi. Unfortunately, Kaidan stole her room in Licentia, so we've got to fix that problem. <br> On gutmaw's [Followers Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40816) page, download *"Kaidan Follower Patch Room A-4"* and *"M'rissi Follower Patch Room A-1"* patches, if you enable both of these under the Added Mods in MO2, Kaidan should now move to Room A-4 and M'rissi gets her room beside Inigo back in Room A-1.
