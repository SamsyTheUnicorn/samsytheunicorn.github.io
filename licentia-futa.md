## FUTA
A guide on how to add futanari options to Licentia, create blended textures, and tweak OAlign/OStim to resolve mis-alignment issues.

1. Get started by downloading EvilReFlex's [SOS - Addon - Futanari CBBE SSE 1.1b](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11344-sos-addon-futanari-cbbe-sse/), this is hosted on LoversLab which is prone to slow download speeds due to the file hosting method, so don't worry if the download speed is slower than expected.
2. Just using ERF's SOS addon will create some seams around the crotch on any characters sporting a schlong, so you will have to download a skin patch for whatever skin texture you are using. Fortunately, the skin used by default on Licentia is Bijin Skin, there is a patch pre-made and available in the comments of a guide on making seamless skins on LoversLab, you can grab that [here](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/137830-easy-way-to-make-seamless-sos-textures/#comment-2913554).
3. This step is only for the skin wizards who want to use an alternative skin texture like [Demoniac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29114), a smoother more reflective skin, or [REALORE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65577), a more "realistic" texture with better skin tones. <br> You will require [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), the seamless Blender project ([Direct Link](https://www.loverslab.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=850650)), and [Texconv](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv). Once you have these tools installed, download and follow Luminox's guide on making a SOS Futa Patch ([Direct Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923586633238986874/967472617000960050/Making_a_SOS_Futa_patch_-_Licentia.pdf)).
4. Install both the SOS Addon, and your skin patch in MO2. You will have two new plugins in your load order, move *"SOS - ERF - Futanari CBBE - Addon.esp"* under *"SOS - Leito Addon SE.esp"* (Priority ~567), and move *"ERF - Futanari CBBE - Equippable.esp"* above *"Book of UUNP Iron and Steel.esp"* (Priority ~255).
5. Now you have the schlong and the skin, but no meshes for OBody to morph the schlong to fit on whatever body you choose to use in Licentia. For this, launch BodySlide x64 and change your group filters to *"3BA"* and *"ERF"*: <br> ![Selecting 3BA and ERF BodySlide groups](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/licentia-futa-img1.png?raw=true)
6. Change your Outfit/Body to "*CBBE 3BBB Body Amazing"*, and select the Preset *"- Zeroed Sliders -"*, thanks to OBody, we don't need to create meshes specifically for your favourite preset, just this one. <br> Now make sure you have *"Build Morphs"*enabled, and then Ctrl+Click the Batch Build button. You will be given a window titled *"Batch Build"* with various slider sets enabled or disabled, make sure all of these are selected/enabled, now press build and you will have to choose a folder to save the meshes we are building. <br> Navigate to the folder where your mods are located and create a new folder titled "Futanari BodySlide Output".
7. Once you have selected the destination folder, you will be asked to choose between some conflicting sets, it's safe to leave these as default (Im Physics) and press OK. If you have any errors, just follow steps 5 and 6 again, it shouldn't error repeatedly and if it does, that is an issue to bring up with support. <br> Back in MO2, refresh your mod list, and you should have a new mod above Overwrite, move this just under "Custom BodySlide SliderGroups" and enable.
8. Now you can launch the game! But we're not done yet... <br> Once you are in-game, and have followed the normal MCM procedure, open the MCM menu for Schlongs of Skyrim and under Player/NPC Settings, set the player SOS addon to "Futanari CBBE". Exit the MCM and use the Vanity Mirror to open RaceMenu, here you can go to the Genitals tab and adjust the size of your schlong using *"SOS Genital Base"*, select something between 1.3 and 1.5. <br> Once you're done playing with that, open the OStrap MCM menu and enable OCum Compatibility and the Futa CBBE Strap-on. Now, open the OSA/OStim menu, open the Config, and then open the General Config, there will be an option with the icon of a top hat, this is *"Gentleman's Scaling"*, enable this and your schlong with automatically be adjusted to fit most scenes. <br> ![Set up Gentleman's Scaling in OSA/OStim](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/samsytheunicorn.github.io/blob/main/licentia-futa-img2.png?raw=true)
9.  Go forth and enjoy!
